# Vans Responsive Portfolio

## Main project goals

- This project introduces the CSS framework Bootstrap to our site to improve responsiveness, uniformity, and scalability.

### HTML

- Creates three separate html files

  - index.html file demonstrates how Bootstraps responsive nature may help maintain a certain layout throughout different viewports
  - portfolio.html file demonstrates how Bootstraps responsive nature may help alter a certain layout depending on their viewports
  - contact.html file demonstrates Bootstraps extensive library that expands into functional components

- Links the html files together via navigation links found within each page

- Uses Bootstrap to create a navigation bar, responsive layout, and responsive images using html classes

- Uses semantic html

- HTML has been validated by [W3](https://validator.w3.org/) (see screenshots)

- Contains my personalized information

- Properly utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system

### CSS

- Uses Bootstrap as the framework

  - Installs Bootstrap directly

    - To experiment other ways to install css files other than those shown in class
    - To further investigate how Bootstrap works

- Minimizes the use of media queries (none was used)

- Uses Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns)

- On an xs screen, content takes up the entire screen

- On sm and larger screens, there are some margins on the left and right sides of the screen

## Installation

- No installation is required. The webpage may be viewed [here](https://vtaymany.github.io/vans-responsive-portfolio/)

## Roadmap

- It would be beneficial to purge out the unused css from Bootstrap using tools such as PurgeCSS

- If implemented correctly, doing so would allow for:
  - increased performance
  - decreased file size
